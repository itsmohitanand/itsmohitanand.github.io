      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-first-post&#34;&gt;My First Post&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my initial post, I will talk about my background and the nature of my projects. I was born and raised in India. After finishing school, I took the engineering entrance examination for the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). When it came to the college counselling process, I had the chance to express my preferences for different engineering branches. I was initially interested in computer science, but I ended up pursuing environmental engineering at IIT(ISM), Dhanbad.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
