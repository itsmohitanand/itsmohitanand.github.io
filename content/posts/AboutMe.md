# My First Post

In my initial post, I will talk about my background and the nature of my projects. I was born and raised in India. After finishing school, I took the engineering entrance examination for the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). When it came to the college counselling process, I had the chance to express my preferences for different engineering branches. I was initially interested in computer science, but I ended up pursuing environmental engineering at IIT(ISM), Dhanbad. 

My undergraduate studies sparked my interest in learning more about my surrounding. However, I realised that I am also interested in the mathematical modelling of complex systems. I gained some exposure to hydrological modelling, which further fueled my desire to delve deeper into this field. As a result, I pursued my Masterâ€™s degree in Environmental Engineering at ETH Zurich, Switzerland.

In 2019, I was exposed to Machine Learning for hydrological modelling. I completed numerous online courses and attended lectures on Machine Learning at ETH Zurich. Inspired by this newfound interest, I designed my MSc project on rainfall nowcasting using ConvLSTM models based on radar images. My passion for this field led me to explore rainfall-runoff modelling further using LSTM networks for Swiss Alpine Catchments. By this time, I had firmly established my desire to work in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, driven by my desire to solve complex real-world problems.

Keeping all this in mind, I started my PhD in the middle of the pandemic in November 2020. Improving the understanding of the complex relationship between climate drivers of extremely high forest loss using deep learning is the goal of my PhD. The problem is challenging as the (forest loss) process is less understood, the observational data is scarce and unstructured, the extremes are difficult to model, and the deep learning models still need to be applied successfully in this field. I did a number of projects during my PhD, the details of which I will not mention here. Each of these projects involved quantitative analysis, working with large datasets (modelled in case of limited observations) using modern deep learning methods like VAEs, Transformers, and Diffusion Models. I firmly believe that AI/ML can help us solve many of the challenges that arise when we have a relatively large amount of data.
